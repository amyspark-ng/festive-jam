Figure out how to turn off the objects when the scene is finished
<!-- onCLick events are not removed when area is removed -->

Do the choosing santa and kid part of the menuscene
Do the starting minigame where it chooses kid and santa

- minigames could be ordered like this
santa0 = collects object amount
santa1 to 3 are the steps for toys
same with kid

i think this implies having some sort of global state or a parameter to the gamescene that has kid and santa
